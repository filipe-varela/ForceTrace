## Force Trace

A utility application used within the context of my Master's Thesis to build 2D planar trajectories with force applied in each point. 

Built on top of Android Compose and uses the stylus on-screen position and pressure to draw the trajectories. The pressure is visualized with color coding --- blue for high pressure (force) and red for low pressure (force). This is aided with a color-bar to the right of the screen with the pressure sensed label.

A [dataset](https://github.com/filipe-varela/ForceTraceDataset) was built with this application, and it's possible to install this in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vilp.forcetrace).
